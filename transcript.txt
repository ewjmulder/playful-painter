Hello viewer and welcome to our 'Playful Painter' class!
There is a lot to cover, so let's quickly head out to the coast and set up our painters easel.

<start application> (or better: switch to running app)

This is a nice spot here with a view of the ocean.
Hmmm, interesting paints we have on our palette, I'm curious what they will do.

But first, we'd like to have a nice picture on our empty canvas. We have a few to pick from under the 'Open' button.
Let's start with a photo of one of the lecturers.

<pick initial image of Matt>

Ah, there is Matt on our Canvas and we can try out some of our playful paints on him.
We'll pick the first one over here, named 'Black & White'.
We move the mouse over the canvas and see, the pointer changes into a brush and we see a circle that shows the brush size.
Now let's paint some black & white!

<paint and comment>

Ah, the darker areas become black and the lighter areas white. That's actually pretty nice.
Hey, look down here we have some sliders to change the effect.
First we have the brush size slider, that seems obvious.

<change value, paint some more>

Indeed, we can paint small details or big patches at once.
There is another slider down here, it sais threshold.

<change value, paint some more>

Ah, the larger the threshold, the darker the result and vice versa.

Ok, that's all very nice, but we can do better than black and white.
Let's pick another image and experiment some more.
Here we have a nice photo of the rare offspring of a duck and a horse, the so-called 'dorse'.

<pick dorse>

Now let's try some other effects. This is a grayscale effect I guess

<paint some gray>

Yep, away with the color. But we like colors, so let's move on to the colory effect. Ah, it's the well known tint effect.

<paint some tint>

And you can set the tint color with these sliders.

<paint some orther tint>

Hmm, that has become quite messy, what can we do about that? This effect sais 'original', let's paint with that.

<paint original>

I see, the original image comes back. It's some sort of effect eraser, nice.
There are a few effects left, so let's try those out on yet another image.
We have a nice sunflower here.

<pick sunflower>

These effects are called sharpen and blur, I guess we all know them from our usual image editing tools.
Much more interesting is this one: 'edge detection'. It will draw lines where edges are found in the original image.

<paint with edge detection>

That gives a nice artictic effect on the flower.
The last one is called circles, let's try it as well.

<paint with circles>

Ooh, that's very arty-farty, nice!

Now let's combine some of these effects and try to get a creative result.
We will use yet another image, this time I will use my own face.
With 'new' we can take a picture from the webcam.

<take picture - bright light!!>

There we go, my own face on the canvas. Now let's try to make something interesting out of me, a challenge indeed. :)

<paint free style>

Ok, I'm quite happy with this result. Now I want to use it elsewhere, so we'll save it.

<click save>

A popup tells us where it has been saved. And to prove that it's indeed there, I'll open it with a photo viewer. There it is, our masterpiece!
We can continue and share this on social media like in the lectures, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer.

All right, that's all! Thanks for watching and enjoy painting playful pictures! Bye!
